            This means we must spend each moment wisely. One cannot go back to a moment of wrongdoing to correct a mistake. What is gone is gone. Above all, nobody can turn back the clock to gain more Time. Therefore, individuals must make every moment

            social media, smartphones, video games, etc. Consequently, a lot of time is taken by these distractions. Due to innovation, many new distractions are constantly coming in thick and fast. Therefore, by reducing the usage of these distractions,
    people can make a lot of Time <bdi> おはようございます</bdi> </strong> <br> <b><bdi>ありがとうございます</bdi></b> </p>
